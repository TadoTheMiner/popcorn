# Popcorn's contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! We are happy to see new contributors!

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

Read our README.md and get familiar with the code base! If you need help, join our [discord](https://discord.gg/2cf6b4sdzM) and we will help you.

you can also contribute in other ways, like opening an issue!

### Issues

If you are experiencing some kind of issue or you have an idea, tell us! Open an issue in the issues tab and explain it. Make sure that you are giving all the information you have.

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/popcorn-kernel/popcorn/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.

### Make Changes

Please follow our [project manager](https://github.com/orgs/popcorn-kernel/projects/1) and see if someone is working on the changed that you wanna add. Just rememeber that we only apply changed that we see fit.

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
2. [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the information about the changes so that we can review your PR.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations! We are happy to see your contributions!
